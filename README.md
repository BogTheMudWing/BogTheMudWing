# Hello!
I'm Stonley890, but also known as Bog The MudWing or just Bog. I play a lot of Minecraft. I'm familiar with both resource packs and data packs for Minecaft: Java Edition. I am a beginner in Java and have experience with JavaScript and Python. I'm also an administrator on a small Minecraft community, enjoy composing and creating music, and create/manage videos on several YouTube channels.

## Featured Projects
### Dreamvisitor
#### A plugin for WoF:TNW to add various features.
Dreamvisitor is a Spigot plugin/Discord bot that allows automatic whitelisting, Discord/Minecraft chat linking, and other quality of life additions like pausing chat and logging server start/stop. It's the reason I started learning Java and there's still a lot I want to add.

### Ex-Queen Battlewinner Boss Fight
#### A custom Ender Dragon boss fight crafted entirely with command blocks.
With help from iDinoSoul, DazzlingPhoenix, and others, this custom boss fight was crafted for the WoF:TNW server. It features a skippable cutscene, several different attacks, and two phases. Click the image below to watch the showcase video.
